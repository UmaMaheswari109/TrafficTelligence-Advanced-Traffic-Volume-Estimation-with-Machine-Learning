# TrafficTelligence-Advanced-Traffic-Volume-Estimation-with-Machine-Learning


TrafficTelligence is an advanced machine learning-based system designed to accurately estimate and predict traffic volume. By analyzing historical traffic data, weather conditions, and events, it provides valuable insights for improving traffic flow, reducing congestion, and enhancing urban mobility. This technology helps transportation authorities implement adaptive traffic control systems, optimize signal timings, and manage road networks more efficiently.

Beyond traffic management, TrafficTelligence supports urban planning and commuter navigation. City planners can leverage its predictions to design better road infrastructure and public transit systems, ensuring smoother traffic movement. Commuters and navigation apps benefit from real-time traffic insights, enabling smarter route planning and congestion avoidance. Built using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Flask, TrafficTelligence offers a data-driven approach to making transportation more efficient and reliable.
